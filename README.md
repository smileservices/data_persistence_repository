**Data Persistence Repository SQL** is a Python package providing a portable SQL repository implementation, following the repository pattern for a data persistence layer. This package facilitates interaction with SQL databases through an abstracted interface, ensuring clean and maintainable database interaction in Python applications.

## Features

- Abstract repository interface for streamlined data layer interactions.
- SQL repository implementation leveraging SQLAlchemy.
- Context manager for robust database session management.
- Comprehensive methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Support for filtering and bulk operations.

## Installation

Install **Data Persistence Repository SQL** from PyPI:

```bash
pip install data_persistence_repository
```

## Usage

Basic usage example:

```python
from data_persistence_repository.sql_repository import SqlRepository

# Initialize the repository
repo = SqlRepository("sqlite:///your_database.db")

# Use the repository within a managed context
with repo.start_session() as session:
    # Perform add, get, delete operations here
```

Replace `"sqlite:///your_database.db"` with your actual database URL.

## Requirements
